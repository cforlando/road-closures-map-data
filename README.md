# road-closures-map-data

### What we are trying to do
Get data from the City of Orlando [Road Closures Map](http://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=80f863e226c948b496d27b179d924f93), restructure it, save it

Check the [Issues](https://github.com/cforlando/road-closures-map-data/issues) to see what we working on. If you have any questions, feel free to submit an issue!

Look further down in the README for Project Resources

## Project Lead: Cassie Wilcox @csndra0504
## Stakeholders: Scott Walker, Natalie Bednarz - City of Orlando

Road Closures Map Data project is a follow up to the [UX project](https://github.com/cforlando/road-closures-ux/blob/master/README.md) exploring the current user experience of Scott Walker, a city employee who creates the documents and uploads the information to the public concerning road closures with in the Orlando city limits. 

Our goal is to create a solution that will have 2 outcomes:

1. Make Scott's job easier, not harder. 
2. Output data in an open format to the Data Portal to be used in a map solution available to the public.
