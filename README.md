# road-closures-map-data
Get data from the road closures map, restructure it, save it

## Project Lead: Cassie Wilcox @csndra0504
## Stakeholders: Scott Walker, Natalie Bednarz - City of Orlando

Road Closures Map Data project is a follow up to the [UX project](https://github.com/cforlando/road-closures-ux/blob/master/README.md) exploring the current user experience of Scott Walker, a city employee who creates the documents and uploads the information to the public concerning road closures with in the Orlando city limits. 

Our goal is to create a solution that will have 2 outcomes:

1. Make Scott's job easier, not harder. 
2. Output data in an open format to the Data Portal to be used in a map solution available to the public.
