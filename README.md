## Run Locally
To fetch latest road closure data run
```
python road_data_fetch.py
```
This will output JSON data from [Orlando's Road Closures Map](http://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=80f863e226c948b496d27b179d924f93) to `road_data.json`

### Project Lead: Cassie Wilcox @csndra0504
### Stakeholders: Scott Walker, Natalie Bednarz - City of Orlando

Road Closures Map Data project is a follow up to the [UX project](https://github.com/cforlando/road-closures-ux/blob/master/README.md) exploring the current user experience of Scott Walker, a city employee who creates the documents and uploads the information to the public concerning road closures with in the Orlando city limits. 

Our goal is to create a solution that will have 2 outcomes:

1. Make Scott's job easier, not harder. 
2. Output data in an open format to the Data Portal to be used in a map solution available to the public.
